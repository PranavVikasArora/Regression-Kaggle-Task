# Regression-Kaggle-Task
Link for Data Set : https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes
Data Set I have worked on : cclass.csv

Task Details (From Kaggle):
The reason I collected this data set was to make a regression model that could inform whether the car he wanted to buy was good value in relation to the market in general. I've extended this data set to include lots of other makes, so it would be cool to extend the car value prediction model.

Expected Submission
Some sort of value regression model.

Evaluation
Low error, and easy to understand output. Should be able to put in custom car details and get a value estimate.
